*******************************STRAPI SUBMENU************************************
built this awesome strapi project using context api , useRef and useState hooks, which basically displays the page links as sidebar on small screen and  once we reach width of 992px it displays page links as submenu .
Here I used various mouse events which when triggered pulls down the submenu and viceversa .
